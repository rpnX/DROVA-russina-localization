Plh_6 { I personally make sure that the fighters can fully concentrate on their training. If you cause any trouble, you'll be dealing with me. }

Plh_14 { Take care of yourself. }

Plh_11 { Finally, a break. Kicking back in the tavern... The best part of the day. Grab some grub and... }

Plh_12 { ... a little Rustmoss too. }

Plh_16 { I've got stuff to do. }
