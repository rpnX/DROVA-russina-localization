Text { Asmus,<br><br>The rustroot delivery has to be canceled, but I can dry the Rustmoss here as planned. I can definitely find a lot more of it in the Red Moor than I was able to grow back in Nemeton. And there's no one here from whom I need to hide it. I can get all the other work on the farm done with ease, and thus I have plenty of time for our business. Once again, it was a bright idea of yours to send me here.<br>The herbalist is just too focused on the druids and doesn't appreciate all the other uses of Rustmoss. Canning me was his biggest mistake. Well, he's not like you. Thanks to you I'm still alive, and I can fully put my abilities to work.<br><br>I hope you'll find the time to come visit me soon, so that we can get to know each other better. I can hardly wait to see you again.<br><br>I'm thinking of you. Delani }
