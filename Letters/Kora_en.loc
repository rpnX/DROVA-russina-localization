Text { I'm no warrior! I'm not cut out for this! The howling, every night... What are we supposed to do when the rippers attack? I'd love to get a good night's sleep!

There are people who can protect us.<br>But I can't leave Larea and Cengiz behind! Cengiz has done so much for us. Gero wants to meet with me and the others tomorrow.<br><br>Again! I heard it! The rippers' howling just never stops! I hope I can get at least some sleep<br><br>.... }
