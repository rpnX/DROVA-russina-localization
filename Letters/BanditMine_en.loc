Entry { Drax, we've found the relic!<br>I'd like to remain in the mine for a few days to see whether we can dig up some more trinkets. We'll sell the relic on the way back, to Olaf at the Headless Ripper Inn.<br><br>In the meantime, grab a keg.<br>It's on me. }

AldriksNote { Gather a few people, Bossar.<br>I've heard some hot talk through a few contacts of mine.<br>A buried ruin, in which the Bygones probably left valuable stuff for us to find.<br>One relic in particular is supposedly worth a pretty fair amount of coin.<br><br>And the best part â€” I've already got a buyer!<br>So this time, we won't have to wait endlessly to get our coins. We just need to capture a few more people to do the dirty work for us.<br><br>But around here, this shouldn't be much of a problem. }
