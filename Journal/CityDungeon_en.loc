Title { The temple near the Forest Primeval }

Entry_01 { North of the Forest Primeval, there are ruins which used to be a temple of the Bygones. Supposedly, a Divine Crystal can be found there. The entrance is said to be west of the Remnants' camp. }

Entry_02 { I found the temple. The crystal must be around here somewhere. }

Entry_03 { The door is locked. I've got to open it somehow. Maybe these statues have something to do with that? }
