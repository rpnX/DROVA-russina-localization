Entry_01 { Farlan trains all day, near the training dummies. He doesn't want to talk to me. How can I get to him? }

Entry_02 { I've asked around. Apparently, I must show Farlan that I've got something on the ball. But how? }

Entry_03 { Farlan is convinced of my worth. He says that I've got the right stuff, and that he'll put in a word with Eugen for me. }

Entry_04 { Now I belong to the Nemeton. }
