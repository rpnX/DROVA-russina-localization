Title { Injured Hewer }

Entry_01 { Agnessa seems to have been injured, and she isn't faring too well. But she doesn't want any help from me. Maybe from someone else, though? }

Entry_01_A { Shona tells me that the shadeshrooms growing around here have healing properties. They could help Agnessa. }

Entry_02 { Mursel is allowing Agnessa a few days' rest before she can hew again. I should tell her. }

Entry_03 { I helped Agnessa. Soon, she'll be able to work again. }
