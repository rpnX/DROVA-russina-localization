Title { My Very Own Talisman }

Entry_01 { I've got a crude talisman, but it's missing a leather cord. The children said that Rura might be able to help. }

Entry_02 { Rura fastened a leather cord to my talisman. Now all I've got to do is purify the talisman in the Eternal Fire of Nemeton. }

Entry_03 { With Myrte's assistance, I was able to cleanse the talisman. But now I've got to engrave something into it. Myrte said: "Look for the night's lights near the stone circle in the center of Nemeton. Play to their dance, and they'll guide you to the Raven's symbol." What's that supposed to mean? }

Entry_04 { On the talisman, I've painted a symbol that's connected with the Great Raven. Am I done now? Maybe I should ask the children. }

Entry_05 { The talisman has received all three of the blessings. It seems completed now. }

Entry_04B { The blessings of life are where the birds have ceased chirping and the frogs' song can be heard. Where three wellsprings of life converge. }

Entry_05A { The talisman â€” responded. These must be the blessings of change. }

Entry_05C { My talisman started vibrating near a menhir. These must be the blessings of the wellspring. }

Entry_05B { There was a strange place in the moor. Ever since I went there, my talisman has been emitting a strange warmth. These were the blessings of life. }

Entry_04A { The blessings of change are in a place haunted by eternal darkness, yet surrounded by light. Five phases of life form the circle of change. }

Entry_04C { The blessings of the wellspring can be found on a small island beyond the overgrown shore. Birds are sitting atop a massive rock and sing their tune in unison. }

Entry_03_Rejected { Myrte will help me only if I'm part of the Nemeton. Maybe I can persuade her to help me regardless? }

Entry_04_Hint { My music caused a firefly to appear. Maybe it will help me recognize what I'm supposed to engrave into the talisman. }
