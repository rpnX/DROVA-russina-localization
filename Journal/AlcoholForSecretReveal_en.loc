Title { Not my Beer }

Entry_01 { Melf hangs out in front of the tavern. He wants a beer. Maybe I should bring him one. }

Entry_02 { After I brought him a beer, Melf told me that there's a treasure buried in the forest northeast of here. I'm supposed to follow the road to the east until I reach a stone circle. North of the stone circle, there's supposed to be a cave. He can't get there on his own because it's too dangerous, but maybe I want to take a look. }

Entry_03 { This must be the place Melf was talking about. Pretty good pickings here. This job was well worth it. }
