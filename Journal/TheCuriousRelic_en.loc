Title { A Relic of the Bygones }

Entry_01 { I've found a relic on the bandits' leader. I need to take it to Olaf in the tavern. }

Entry_02 { Olaf gave me a key. I'm supposed to go through the door in the kitchen corner. It leads to a cave, in which I'm supposed to meet someone named Ede. }

Entry_03 { Ede gave me a bunch of coins for the relic. }
