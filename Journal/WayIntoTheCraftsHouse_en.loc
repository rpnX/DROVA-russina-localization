Entry_01 { Rura wants me to take Muc to her. He's supposed to help with the work. Rura said that he wanted to go to Georgefarm, but he might already be done there and be lazing near the apple grove east of Nemeton. I should take a look around there. }

Entry_04 { Rura was really relieved when Muc arrived. Finally, he can assist her with work. Now she's going to teach me something about blacksmithing. }
