Title { The Power of Potions }

Entry_01 { Aidan, in the Remnants' camp, is experimenting with potions. He wants to brew up a powerful potion of strength. To do this, he needs a rare basaltroot, which apparently grows in the caves. If I bring him this root, he'll brew the potion for me â€” even though he isn't sure whether it will work. }

Entry_02 { The potion worked. }
