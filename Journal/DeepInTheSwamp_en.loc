Title { The Man in the Moor }

Entry_0 { Bonny in Nemeton is missing Henik, who ventured into the Red Moor south of the camp a while ago. }

Entry_01 { Henik needs my help catching a mandragora â€” a kind of sentient plant that flees whenever you get too close to it. I'm supposed to talk to him once I'm ready to accompany him. He'll wait for me on the moor south of Nemeton. }

Entry_01A { I found Henik in the moor just as he was about to catch a mandragora. I already had one with me, and I gave it to him. Now he's on his way to Nemeton, and he's promised me a reward. }

Entry_02 { Henik and I set out to the Red Moor. He says I should stay close to him. }

Entry_03 { The mandragora is close. If I wear the ear protection, I can try to catch it while Henik keeps the foglings at bay. }

Entry_05 { Henik's got the mandragora. I'm supposed to meet him near Nemeton, where he wants to give me a reward for helping him. }

Entry_06 { Henik gave me a few coins for my help. }

Entry_07 { Henik doesn't need any more help from me. }
